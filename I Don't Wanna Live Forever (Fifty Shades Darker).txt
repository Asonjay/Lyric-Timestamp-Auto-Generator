[00:17.030]Been sitting, eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping you'd call
[00:24.640]It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
[00:31.780]Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
[00:40.770]Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
[00:44.480]What is happening to me?
[00:47.430]I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
[00:54.910]And I don't wanna fit wherever
[01:00.390]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[01:09.880]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[01:17.840]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[01:23.260]I'm sitting, eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
[01:30.270]Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life
[01:36.890]Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
[01:47.010]I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
[01:50.780]What is happening to me?
[01:53.610]I don't wanna live forever,'cause I know I'll be living in vain
[02:02.430]And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
[02:07.630]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[02:16.220]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[02:24.300]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[02:28.970]I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
[02:32.410]Baby, baby, I feel crazy
[02:36.450]I see you around in all these empty faces
[02:41.210]Up all night, all night and every day
[02:44.460]I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
[02:49.820]Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
[02:52.640]Now I'm in a cab, tell 'em where your place is
[02:57.440]What is happening to me?
[02:59.990]I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
[03:08.540]And I don't wanna fit wherever
[03:13.620]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[03:22.430]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[03:30.480]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[03:38.500]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[03:46.880]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[03:54.860]I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
[04:03.180]Until you come back home
