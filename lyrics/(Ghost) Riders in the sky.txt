[00:11.77]An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
[00:18.49]Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
[00:25.08]When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows, he saw
[00:29.76]Plowed through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
[00:39.40]Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
[00:46.34]Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath you could feel
[00:52.54]A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
[00:57.01]For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
[01:06.18]Yipie I oh, yipie I ay, ghost riders in the sky
[01:50.96]Their face is gaunt, their eyes were blurred
[01:53.05]Their shirts all soaked with sweat
[01:57.74]He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he 'ain't caught 'em yet
[02:03.92]'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
[02:08.34]On horses snorting fire as they ride on, hear them cry
[02:19.30]As the riders leaned on by him, he heard one call his name
[02:27.67]If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
[02:32.22]Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
[02:36.73]Tryin' to catch the devil herd across these endless skies
[02:45.80]Yipie I oh, yipie I ay, ghost riders in the sky
[03:03.97]Ghost riders in the sky, ghost riders in the sky
[03:25.69]
