[00:05]There's a dark and a troubled side of life.
[00:09]There's a bright and a sunny side too.
[00:15]But if you meet with the darkness and strife,
[00:19]The sunny side we also may view.
[00:24]Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
[00:29]Keep on the sunny side of life.
[00:32]It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
[00:37]If we keep on the sunny side of life.
[00:42]Oh, the storm and its fury broke today,
[00:47]Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear.
[00:52]Clouds and storms will in time pass away.
[00:57]The sun again will shine bright and clear.
[01:02]Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
[01:07]Keep on the sunny side of life.
[01:11]It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
[01:15]If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.
[01:39]Let us greet with a song of hope each day.
[01:44]Though the moments be cloudy or fair.
[01:49]Let us trust in our Saviour always,
[01:54]To keep us, every one, in His care.
[01:59]Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
[02:04]Keep on the sunny side of life.
[02:07]It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
[02:12]If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.
