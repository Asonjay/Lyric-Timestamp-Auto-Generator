[00:49.490]I was on my way to you and I was worried
[00:55.490]I was all torn up and nervous 'cause I knew that you'd be gone
[01:02.490]I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
[01:08.490]And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone
[01:15.490]It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
[01:21.490]Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
[01:27.490]It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
[01:33.490]Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
[01:47.490]I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
[01:53.490]I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
[02:00.490]I was broken in a million little pieces
[02:06.490]When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me
[02:11.490]It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
[02:19.490]Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
[02:25.490]It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
[02:32.490]Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy, let her go
