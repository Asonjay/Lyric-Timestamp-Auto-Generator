[00:00.100]“Four score and seven years ago”, so began the message “
[00:05.020]of a war-weary president, Abraham Lincoln.
[00:08.820]A message written on the back of an envelope, on a train,
[00:10.720]
[00:12.200]on the way to dedicate a battlefield,
[00:15.620]where men from the north and south had died at Gettysburg Pennsylvania.
[00:21.280]
[00:24.740]"Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent
[00:30.780]a new nation, conceived in liberty
[00:34.500]and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
[00:40.340]
[00:41.160]Now we're engaged in a great civil war,
[00:44.160]testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
[00:49.060]and so dedicated, can long endure.
[00:53.260]We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
[00:56.280]We have come to dedicate a portion of that field
[00:59.040]as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives,
[01:03.920]that that nation might live.
[01:06.120]It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
[01:11.920]But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
[01:15.500]We cannot hallow this ground
[01:18.060](The) brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
[01:24.240]have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
[01:31.760]The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,
[01:36.740]but it can never forget what they did here.
[01:39.540]It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
[01:44.800]which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
[01:49.740]It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us:
[01:55.760]that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
[02:00.340]to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;
[02:05.460]that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
[02:12.500]that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom
[02:19.220]and that government of the people, by the people,  for the people,
[02:27.980]shall not perish from the earth.
[02:35.180]
