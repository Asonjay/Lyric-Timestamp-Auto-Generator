[00:12.072]An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
[00:18.795]Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
[00:25.261]When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
[00:29.696]Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
[00:39.530]Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
[00:46.322]Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
[00:52.847]A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
[00:57.224]For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries
[01:06.337]Yippie I oh oh oh
[01:10.494]Yippie I aye ye ye
[01:16.206]Ghost riders in the sky
[01:51.291]Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
[01:57.619]He's riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught em yet
[02:04.062]Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
[02:08.497]On horses snorting fire as they ride on hear their cries
[02:19.411]As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
[02:27.689]'If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
[02:32.890]Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
[02:37.046]Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
[02:45.939]Yippie I oh oh oh
[02:49.898]Yippie I aye ye ye
[02:55.320]Ghost riders in the sky
[03:04.272]Ghost riders in the sky
[03:13.200]Ghost riders in the sky
