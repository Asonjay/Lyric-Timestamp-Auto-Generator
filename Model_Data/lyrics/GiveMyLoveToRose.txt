[00:07.40]I found him by the railroad track this morning
[00:13.55]I could see that he was nearly dead
[00:19.42]I knelt down beside him and I listened
[00:24.91]To hear the words the dying fellow said
[00:30.66]He said They let me out of prison out in Frisco
[00:36.63]For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
[00:42.32]I was trying to get back to Louisiana
[00:48.26]To see my Rose and get to know my son
[00:54.57]Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
[01:00.53]Take her all my money Tell her buy some pretty clothes
[01:06.32]Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
[01:11.83]And don't forget to give my love to Rose
[01:24.26]Telling my six plans for waiting for me
[01:30.26]Tell my boy to help his mom at home
[01:36.14]Tell my Rose to try to find another
[01:41.33]For it ain't right that she should live alone
[01:47.70]Mister here's a bag with all my money
[01:53.70]It won't last them long the way it goes
[01:59.58]God bless you for finding me this morning
[02:04.89]Please don't forget to give my love to Rose
[02:11.51]Give my love to Rose please won't you Mister
[02:17.26]Take her all my money Tell her buy some pretty clothes
[02:23.14]Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
[02:28.64]And don't forget to give my love to Rose
