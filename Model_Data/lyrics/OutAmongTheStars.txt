[00:05.98]It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
[00:11.67]Closing time another day is done
[00:16.79]When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
[00:21.96]He can't find a job but Lord he's found a gun
[00:27.82]He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
[00:33.00]Then he lets the old man run out in the street
[00:38.47]Even though he knows they'll come with guns ablazing
[00:44.17]Already he can feel that great relief
[00:50.10]Oh how many travelers get weary
[00:55.60]Bearing both their burdens and their scars
[01:01.14]Don't you think they'd love to start all over
[01:06.45]And fly like eagles out among the stars
[01:11.97]He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
[01:16.91]Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
[01:22.83]He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
[01:28.35]They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives
[01:34.06]Oh how many travelers get weary
[01:39.60]Bearing both their burdens and their scars
[01:44.95]Don't you think they'd love to start all over
[01:50.32]And fly like eagles out among the stars
[01:59.00]The evening news carries all the details
[02:04.23]He dies in every living room in town
[02:09.88]And in his own a bottle is thrown in anger
[02:14.90]And his father cries we'll never live this down
[02:20.88]Oh how many travelers get weary
[02:26.26]Bearing both their burdens and their scars
[02:31.94]Don't you think they'd love to start all over
[02:37.16]And fly like eagles out among the stars
[02:42.72]And fly like eagles out among the stars
