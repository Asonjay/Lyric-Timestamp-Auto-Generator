[00:10.56]I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
[00:17.73]With sword and pistol by my side
[00:22.66]Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
[00:28.53]Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
[00:34.14]The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:39.69]But I am still alive.
[00:46.18]I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
[00:53.31]And with the sea I did abide.
[00:58.01]I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
[01:03.75]I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
[01:09.63]And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
[01:15.17]But I am living still.
[01:21.74]I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
[01:28.64]Where steel and water did collide
[01:33.58]A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
[01:39.40]I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
[01:45.57]They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
[01:50.63]But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
[02:00.05]around and around
[02:09.35]I fly a starship across the Universe divide
[02:16.09]And when I reach the other side
[02:20.71]I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
[02:26.51]Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
[02:32.56]Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
[02:37.80]But I will remain
[02:41.30]And I'll be back again, again..and again and again and again
